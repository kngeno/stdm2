GUI Style Guidelines
========================

In order for all graphical user interface elements to appear consistent and to all the user to instinctively use dialogs,
it is important that the following guidelines are followed in layout and design of GUIs.


QGIS Developer Human Interface Guidelines (HIG)
-------------------------------------------------------

* Group related elements using group boxes: Try to identify elements that can be grouped together and then use group boxes with a label to identify the topic of that group. 
  Avoid using group boxes with only a singlewidget / item inside.

* Capitalise first letter only in labels, tool tips, descriptive text, and other non-heading or title text:  Theseshould be written as a phrase with leading capital letter, 
  and all remaining words written with lower casefirst letters, unless they are nouns

* Capitalize all words in Titles (group box, tab, list view columns, and so on), Functions (menu items, but-tons), 
  and other selectable items (combobox items, listbox items, tree list items, and so on):  Capitalize allwords, except prepositions that are shorter than five letters (for example, 
  ‘with’ but ‘Without’), conjunctions(for example, and, or, but), and articles (a, an, the). However, always capitalize the first and last word.

* Do not end labels for widgets or group boxes with a colon: Adding a colon causes visual noise and does notimpart additional meaning, so don’t use them.

* Keep harmful actions away from harmless ones:  If you have actions for ‘delete’, ‘remove’ etc, try to im-pose adequate space between the harmful action 
  and innocuous actions so that the users is less likely toinadvertently click on the harmful action.

* Always use a QButtonBox for ‘OK’, ‘Cancel’ etc buttons: Using a button box will ensure that the order of‘OK’ and ‘Cancel’ etc, 
  buttons is consistent with the operating system / locale / desktop environment thatthe user is using.

* Tabs should not be nested.  If you use tabs, follow the style of the tabs used in QgsVectorLayerProperties /QgsProjectProperties etc. 
  i.e. tabs at top with icons at 22x22.

* Widget stacks should be avoided if at all possible.  They cause problems with layouts and inexplicable (tothe user) resizing of dialogs to accommodate widgets that are not visible.

* Try to avoid technical terms and rather use a laymans equivalent e.g.  use the word ‘Opacity’ rather than‘Alpha Channel’ (contrived example), ‘Text’ instead of ‘String’ and so on.

* Use consistent iconography. If you need an icon or icon elements, please contact Robert Szczepanek on themailing list for assistance.

* Place long lists of widgets into scroll boxes. No dialog should exceed 580 pixels in height and 1000 pixelsin width.

* Separate advanced options from basic ones. Novice users should be able to quickly access the items neededfor basic activities without needing to concern themselves with complexity 
  of advanced features. Advancedfeatures should either be located below a dividing line, or placed onto a separate tab.

* Don’t add options for the sake of having lots of options.  Strive to keep the user interface minimalistic anduse sensible defaults.

* If clicking a button will spawn a new dialog, an ellipsis char (. . . )  should be suffixed to the button text.Note, 
  make sure to use the U+2026 Horizontal Ellipsis char instead of three periods.




Microsoft Inductive User Interface (IUI)
---------------------------------------------

This topic describes the user interface model known as inductive user interface (IUI). Also called inductive navigation, 
the IUI model suggests how to make software applications simpler by breaking features into screens or pages that are easy to explain and understand. 

* The first step in designing an IUI is to take a feature or set of features and break it into separate screens. Each screen should be focused on a single task, 
  called the screen's primary task.

* Each screen should be titled with a concise and explicit statement of its primary task. This can be a direct instruction or a question you want the user to answer.

* The title of the screen is very important. Whether the product uses windows, web-style pages, dialogs, or another design, the title should not be allowed to scroll off.

* Make the screen's contents suit the task

* Provide a clear exit from the screen

* The last step in designing a screen is to provide links to secondary tasks, which are features that do not directly accomplish the primary task, but are related to the screen.
  For example, if the primary task on a screen is to write a letter, secondary tasks on that screen might be to look up a mailing address or print an envelope.

* When designing software that follows the IUI model, you should create a template to use as a guide for every screen. The inductive model does not dictate that you use 
  any particular template.
